<!--
  Hey Mabry, a couple of pointers for your first webpage submission:

  First of all, it looks like you got your page title, comments, and heading levels all sorted out. Good stuff!
  There are really only two errors on this submission. First off, the link from your homepage is broken.
  As an example in class, I used "LASTNAME/wdsub/week1.html" but LASTNAME is just a placeholder for each student's last name.
  You'll see this a lot in my example code, where I'll use a placeholder where you'll use a specific value.
  Please fix your link to replace "LASTNAME" with "sigmon"
  Secondly, your DOCTYPE declaration needs to have a ! directly before the word doctype.
  Without this, the browser gets confused about what version of html you are using, and it renders the head and html tags differently.
  Visit this webpage and use the Inspect tool to see just how much of a difference that one ! makes.

<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Week 1 Submission</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!--this is the comment for paragraph-->
      <p>this is the content of a webpg</p>
     <!-- <p>another paragraph for cotent</p>-->
      <h1>Week 1 Submission</h1>
      <h2>html</h2>
      <p>this tells the browser that the contents are in html</p>
      <h2>head</h2>
      <p>this is a container for info not displayed on the pg</p>
      <h3>title</h3>
      <p>this always lives in the head. It is necessary for a valid HTML5 pg.</p>
      <h2>body</h2>
      <p>this containes all content that will apperar on the webpg.</p>
