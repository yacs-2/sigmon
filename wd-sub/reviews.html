<hr> 
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)"target="_blank">The Hobbit</a> or There and Back Again is a story about a hobbit, <em>Mr Bilbo Baggins</em> - one of the several character species that lived in the Middle-earth, a time long ago from now, sometime during middle-ages in the region around the UK. Well, the story isn’t about a hobbit, but more about an adventure he joins along with a party of dwarves - another species in Middle-earth. Tolkien’s style of writing is unique and I gradually started liking it, even grinning occsionally as I read about various happenings during the adventure..</p>

  <h3 class="heading">Animal Farm:</h3>
</div>
<hr>  
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a> tells the story of farm animals who rebel against their oppressive human master in hope for a better life. The story seems simple at first, but as it unfolds, the plot thickens, becoming more intriguing and compelling with every chapter. Exploring corruption, manipulation, political recession, totalitarianism, and communism, George Orwell's allegorical novel manages to depict a whole era. </p>
